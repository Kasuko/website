Welcome to my new homepage. I was using flavours.me to host my site and just put all my social media up there and not think about it. However, it appears that flavours.me is shutting down so I have to figure something out.

So now I guess I will give netlify.com a try. They allow you to host really cool static site generators, so welcome to my attempt at a Hexo site!

In the future I think I will be posting some D&D information here about the two campaigns I am currently running and also some information about as well as the West Marches style campaign I am starting up!

Looking forward to seeing how this works out!
